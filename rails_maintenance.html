        <h2 id="the-pitch">The Pitch</h2>
        <p>Stuff happens and sometimes you find yourself <em>with</em> a Ruby on Rails app, but <em>without</em>
          developers to <em>properly</em> maintain it. As long as you keep paying your server bills, a well-written app
          will keep running for many more months. The problem is that once you stop maintaining it, your app starts
          accumulating problems: you're not applying security updates, you're not fixing bugs and you're not
          doing the work required to keep your app happily purring along.
        </p>
        <p>We offer our Ruby on Rails Maintenance Service for companies with <em>existing</em> Ruby on Rails
          applications that need to be maintained by professional Rails developers.
          We can even update your app a from time to time as you need. The best match for your service are applications
          that are in <strong>active use</strong> and have <strong>business value</strong> for your company.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your application has no business value, then honestly ask yourself why you are not just shutting it down?
        </p>
        <p>Still here? Great! Your app has business value, so we can to help you maintain it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2 id="the-service">Our Services</h2>
        <p>Our Ruby on Rails maintenance service plans follow a progression: we start with the basics of <strong>good
          hosting</strong>, then we add <strong>good maintenance</strong>, then we add <strong>minor feature
          development</strong>, and finally there is <strong>major feature development</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>Bare Essentials: host it and forget it</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Host the application on a server, connect it to the internet</li>
          <li>Have (and renew) a domain name that points to the server</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is the service level for a hobby project without business value.</p>

        <h3>Proper Hosting: focus on security and stability</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Actively check for security updates to your application, and apply them</li>
          <li>Regularly apply security updates for the server's software</li>
          <li>Make regular backups so your data can be restored when something goes wrong</li>
          <li>Have (and renew) your SSL certificates so users can reach your app via HTTPS</li>
          <li>Pro-actively use tools to keep hackers and bots out of your server and application</li>
          <li>Monitor application uptime and handle outages by getting the site back up in a <em>reasonable</em>
            time
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Given that the <strong>GDPR</strong> exists, ensuring your application and its data are secure is now a
          legal obligation for most applications. There is no excuse to do anything less than Proper Hosting.
        </p>

        <h3>Proper Maintenance: focus on long-term stability and growth</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pro-actively find and fix bugs, especially those that impact a lot of users or have impact on your
            profits
          </li>
          <li>Improve automated test code coverage to improve reliability, maintainability and to speed up future
            development
          </li>
          <li>Monitor application performance, improve it when needed and scale servers <em>before</em> you outgrow them
            due to organic growth
          </li>
          <li>Keep the code libraries used by your application up-to-date, so future development will be
            easier/cheaper
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're not keeping up, you're lagging behind. This applies to your application's features in a competitive
          business landscape, but it also applies to the software and code libraries that your application was built on.
          Keeping everything up to date means you benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes, and developers
          can always get started with feature development when required rather than having to update your app first.
        </p>

        <h3>Incremental Improvement: time for the application to become better</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Develop small new features for the application</strong></li>
          <li>Improve the code quality, to improve performance and/or maintainability</li>
          <li>Improve documentation of the application to help long-term maintainability and onboarding new developers
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now we are getting somewhere! Once all previous things have been taken care of, it is time to start improving
          your application. While doing this, we follow the Boy Scout Rule: leave things in a better state than you
          found it. That means we try to improve the code we are working with, and its documentation, while we develop
          new features. The more work we do, the better the code becomes.
        </p>

        <h3>Active Development: make the app the best it can be</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Develop major new features for the application</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Only when your application is in good shape, does it become responsible to perform major feature development.
          At this point you're beyond a basic maintenance contract, so maybe it's time to
          <a href="#contact">talk</a>
          about that.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2 id="the-plans">The Plans</h2>
        <p>Our goals for these plans are for them to be <strong>honest</strong>, <strong>transparent</strong> and
          <strong>sustainable</strong>. This means that we determine our plan availability based on current and
          near-future developer workload. We don't over-sell and we don't under-deliver. We would rather say no to a new
          client (or rather, "maybe start with a smaller plan") than say yes and be unable to fulfill our obligations to
          current clients.
        </p>

        <p>Our service comes with a monthly update report which accompanies each invoice. It will give you a short
          overview of what we did for your app during that month, such as feature development, security updates, bug
          fixes, server scaling, and making improvements to the code. As we get to know you and your app better, we will
          try to include some useful or interesting metrics to give you a bit more feeling for how your application is
          running.
        </p>

        <h3 id="baseline-service">Baseline Level of Service: what you always get</h3>
        <p>This is included as the <em>baseline</em> level of service for all of our clients, regardless of what plan
          they are on.

          and we will see what your needs are and how we can help you. It is likely that you will end up

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h3>Extras</h3>
        <p>Sometimes you have requirements that fall outside of our plans. Here are some common requests and their usual
          rates.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>High workload server hosting</strong>. When your needs are larger or more complicated that a small
            to medium sized application requires, we <em>can</em> accommodate you. Just reach out, explain your needs or
            share your server load / traffic stats, and we will help you find the best server setup.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Microservices</strong>. Let's talk and see how we can treat those as one or a few services instead
            of a lot of services. Good microservices tend to be smaller, better tested and easier to maintain. Bad
            microservices... well, we'll handle that when we encounter them.
          </li>
          <li><strong>24/7 uptime monitoring &amp; more than 99.9% uptime</strong> (instead of a fast response during
            business hours):
            contact us to make your case. 99% uptime is easy. 99.9% uptime usually happens without effort as wel. Going
            above this requires serious effort, which requires serious money. It is usually not worth it unless your app
            generates more than € 1,000,000 per year. Those kinds of apps require a dedicated development team, not
            simply a maintenance plan.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Urgent enhancements</strong>. €1,000/day. Yes, this is intentionally high in order to discourage
            them. On rare occasions you might have a <em>real</em> emergency, for which we <em>are</em> willing to drop
            everything and help you
            right now. A side effect is that it disrupts our planning, raises stress levels and is not good to do very
            often.<br/>
            Unfortunately a lot of "urgent" enhancement requests are the result of clients not properly planning or
            communicating their timeline with us, so they expect us to fix their problem. We hope that this high price
            tag encourages better planning, because nobody benefits from poor planning.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="onboarding">Onboarding</h2>
        <p>Before we can get started, we would prefer to have a quick (video/phone/skype) chat with you about your
          application, your business and how it all fits together. How important is the app, who are the primary
          users (is it mostly internal to the company or is it customer/user-facing?) and roughly how heavy is the
          usage? What plans and expectations do you have for the application? Do you want to keep adding features or
          a regular basis, or is the app mostly done and do you simply want to keep it up and running?
        </p>
        <p>Next, once we decide that there's a fit and we can work together, we'll need to get access to the
          application's source code (preferrably with the code commit history of your previous developers for
          historic context), to your old servers (to observe how it was configured and make the transition smoother)
          and/or to an export of your database (as a last resort).
        </p>
        <p>Really: the more information we can get, the better. If you have technical details to share or
          documentation of any kind, we'd love to hear about this or read it. If not, we'll have to rely on our
          experience and hints scattered in the code to piece together what your application was supposed to do.
          That might lead to a rocky start.
        </p>
        <p>Based on the size of the database and your indicated volume of traffic we'll try to estimate how large the
          server needs
          to be to host your application. We can then proceed to set it up and get your application up and running.
        </p>
        <p>If you own your own domain name and control your DNS Server, we can provide you with an IP address for the
          new server once that's setup. If you want us to handle DNS for you, we'll need to arrange for a transfer.
          If any of this is confusing, no worries: we'll help you.
        </p>
        <p>Besides getting your application up and running on our server, we'd be curious if your application has
          automated tests of any sort. These are sort of a "proof" of how your application is <em>supposed</em> to
          work, which we need to rely on when errors or bugs occur and we need to fix them, or to check that we don't
          break your app when we perform updates or if you request changes in the future.
        </p>
        <p>For the entire onboarding experience we expect to spend at least a day. We'll take that from the (feature
          development) time budget of your first month.
        </p>
        <p>In summary, a checklist of things to prepare for onboarding:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you have access to the source code? We prefer a full checkout of the version control system of your
            previous developer (git, svn or someting else) but if things get really dire we might be able to scrape
            this from your server if we can get a login there.
          </li>
          <li>Do you have access to your server(s) and/or database? Any kind of ssh login here would be really
            helpful in transitioning your server from their servers to ours.
          </li>
          <li>How is your DNS or domain name setup? If you manage it yourself, great! If your previous developer
            did, then we'll need to transition this. Related question: how is your email setup? If your old
            developer hosted this themselves as well, you'll probably need to migrate this to a dedicated email
            provider. Google G Suite, Microsoft Office 365 and FastMail are all equally good options. We can help if
            you can't come to a solution with your previous provider.
          </li>
          <li>How are you using the application? Is it internal/external? How many users are there, how much traffic
            goes through it? Rough estimates are fine. It is useful to know if we are dealing with a hundred or a
            million users. The same goes for the size of your database: does it contain just a few thousand items or
            does it contain ten years of history for a million customers?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As said before, we prefer to get as much info as needed, but if you can't get all of it then don't worry
          too much either. We'll figure it out together.
        </p>
        <p>We hope to talk to you soon!</p>
