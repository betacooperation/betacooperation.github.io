    <h2>What can we do for you?</h2>
    <p>Hi, we're Beta Corp! We build and deliver <em>custom web applications</em>.</p>
    <p>If you have a problem that needs to be solved with software, and you are looking for a long-term <em>tech
        partner</em> to help you solve it, then Beta Corp wants you as a client!</p>
    <p>We also offer consultancy services for when you only require our expertise.</p>
    <p><a href="#contact">Contact us!</a></p>

    <h2>How do we work?</h2>
    <p> We work together with our clients. This means we build and deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) as early as
        we can. Then you start using the app and we continuously deliver updates.</p>
    <p>Using the app while it is being created allows you to provide feedback, and possibly change directions,
        before a lot of time and money has been spent creating something you don't want or need.</p>
    <p>Every day your app will become more <strong>awesome</strong>.</p>
    <p>Because we deliver results early in the process, you and your team get a great feel for what we are building.
        It also means there is less risk of things going wrong, deadlines slipping or the project going over budget.</p>
    <p>Others may call this process Lean or Agile, for us it is just common sense.</p>


    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>Beta Corp was founded to formalise the cooperation between five experienced freelance software developers, and to
        make it easier for our clients to work with us.</p>
    <p>You deal with one company instead of an individual, so there is no longer the awkward <em>&quot;bus
        problem&quot;</em> to worry about.</p>

    <p>Depending on your needs, wants and budget, we choose a team suited for the task.</p>
    <p>We are always looking for talented people to work with us. We ask that you have a little or a lot of
        experience in one or more areas of the interwebs and that you do not mind being an independent contractor.
        If you require job security, this may not be for you. However, if you have never been your own boss, but it is
        something you have always dreamed about, we would love to help you get started!</p>
    <p>Still interested? <a
            href="mailto:info@betacorp.nl?subject=Let's talk about lunch!&body=Hi, I would like to meet you, and talk about joining forces. :-D How about we plan for lunch next week ?">Click
        here to get in touch</a>. Show us what you can do, and we will contact you.</p>

    <h2>What do we use?</h2>
    <p>Most clients do not care about how the problem gets solved, just that we solve it. Some clients are looking
        for specific technologies, but don't need a long explanation. Either way, this section can be brief.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Elixir</dt>
        <dd>A new syntax for the Erlang language, which has been powering telecom for over 30 years. It allows us to
            develop quickly, is great at concurrency, and scales well under load. The Phoenix framework offers
            everything a modern web app requires, but makes it surprisingly easy to use.
        </dd>
        <dt>Ruby / Ruby on Rails</dt>
        <dd>In 2005 Rails unleashed a revolution in the web development world. We were there at the beginning, and
            enjoyed it for over a decade. Elixir and Phoenix are leading the new revolution, and of course we are there
            once again!
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Cooperation</h2>
    <p>We work together <em>with</em> a client instead of <em>for</em> a customer. We are your <em>tech partner</em>
        after all! When you ask for the impossible or, even worse, for something that will hurt your interests, we will
        refuse your request. Then we will explain why. Our interest is to make the project succeed, and sometimes
        that means it is time for real talk.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We'll listen to you</li>
        <li>We'll ask a lot of questions</li>
        <li>We'll tell you what you <em>really</em> want</li>
        <li>We'll perform our magic and make it happen</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Whatâ€™s the objective?</h2>
    <p>Is there a problem? If so what is the problem? Do you want to sell a product or service. What are
        possible solutions. Does that involve or require an app or a website? Do you need a combination of technologies?
        Is a website really necessary? Sometimes we can help you out by offering quick solutions in the form of
        existing services/tools. As much as we like to build things, it's a waste of time and money to reinvent the
        wheel.</p>

    <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
    <p>
        By now you have a good idea of what we do and how we do it. The next step is for you to reach out, so we can
        start working together.
